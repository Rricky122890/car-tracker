# Car Tracker App

Personal Project for a Car Tracking I have a buch of cars allover the place that I need to keep track of. All of my friends just drive them allover the country and leaves them allover the place. So I've made this app so that I don't lose track of them. 

## Installation
npm install and npm run dev

Have fun!
